# MCAN-10 opendbc Mazda candidate signal evidence

Status: upstream candidates recorded; no locally verified Mazda definitions.

## Pin and provenance

The candidate source is comma.ai/opendbc at the exact commit
`95f3d52f474b677c28fc8f10fef3f2f0386aff92`, accessed 2026-08-16. The commit was
resolved from `refs/heads/master`; the branch is not a dependency. The source
repository is [comma.ai/opendbc](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc), licensed
under MIT. The upstream notice is `Copyright (c) 2020, Comma.ai, Inc.` and the
exact permission and disclaimer text is preserved in
[`third_party/licenses/opendbc-MIT.txt`](../../third_party/licenses/opendbc-MIT.txt),
with the attribution index in
[`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

The extraction reads these paths at that commit:

- [`opendbc/dbc/mazda_2017.dbc`](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/blob/95f3d52f474b677c28fc8f10fef3f2f0386aff92/opendbc/dbc/mazda_2017.dbc)
  for message IDs and field definitions;
- [`opendbc/car/mazda/carstate.py`](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/blob/95f3d52f474b677c28fc8f10fef3f2f0386aff92/opendbc/car/mazda/carstate.py)
  for the upstream consumer references; and
- [`opendbc/car/mazda/values.py`](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/blob/95f3d52f474b677c28fc8f10fef3f2f0386aff92/opendbc/car/mazda/values.py)
  and [`docs/CARS.md`](https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/blob/95f3d52f474b677c28fc8f10fef3f2f0386aff92/docs/CARS.md)
  for the upstream model-scope lead.

The candidate matrix is an opendbc-derived field extraction distributed as
project documentation. No full opendbc source tree or DBC file is vendored in
this repository, and no vehicle capture is included. This document is a
provenance record and candidate lead, not a compatibility claim. Build and test
tooling has no opendbc download or floating-branch input.

## Upstream candidate matrix

The field syntax below preserves the DBC definition: `start|length@endian`
followed by `(scale,offset)`, limits, and unit. `@0` is Motorola/big-endian
and `@1` is Intel/little-endian. The source DBC contains no `GenMsgCycleTime`
or equivalent period declaration for these messages. Therefore the expected
period is deliberately **unspecified** until a reviewed, privacy-safe replay
or isolated-bench observation establishes it; no decoder freshness threshold
may be inferred from this table.

Every row is an **upstream candidate — unverified for the Australian target**.
The target is an Australian-market 2019 Mazda CX-5 Akera; regional, trim,
powertrain, ECU software, and bus differences remain open questions. No row
is locally verified, and no row authorizes active probing, transmission, or a
claim of vehicle compatibility.

The source's unusual limits are reproduced verbatim. These are DBC-declared
ranges, not vehicle observations; a field's representable bit width may be
broader or narrower than its declared range. Values must not be silently
normalized before local evidence exists.

## Local verification boundary

| Definition class | Local evidence in this change | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mazda CAN IDs, field positions, scaling, units, values, periods, or bus assignment | None; no raw capture, VIN, location, absolute time, or vehicle-derived fixture is included | Not locally verified |
| Australian-market 2019 CX-5 Akera compatibility | None | Unknown; do not claim compatibility |

Future validation must use the receive-only staged procedure and a reviewed,
privacy-safe fixture or isolated-bench evidence. Until then, these definitions
remain leads only. No active probing, diagnostic polling, CAN transmission, or
vehicle release artifact is in scope for MCAN-10.
