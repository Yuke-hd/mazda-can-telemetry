# MCAN-14 Mazda decoders

Status: portable decoder implementation; the listed signal definitions are
confirmed from the capture-derived DBC supplied for #51.

The decoder accepts a `vehicle_core::RawCanFrame` and writes only semantic
fields in a `VehicleState`; it has no CAN driver, transport, polling,
injection, board header, or global clock dependency. `raw_capture::ReplayHarness`
can call the same functions used by a receive path, so replay tests do not
have a second decoder implementation.

## Confirmed fields and retained candidate

DBC start bits use the DBC notation from the reviewed source. The decoder
locations show the corresponding fixed payload byte and LSB masks.

Selector and actual transmission gear are separate signals. Selector values
are `1=P`, `2=R`, `3=N`, and `4=D`. Actual gear raw zero is the DBC's `P_or_N`
value and retains the existing `ActualGear::Park` representation through its
`ParkOrNeutral` alias. Invalid enumeration values leave the corresponding
signal untouched and cannot create a valid value. Boolean fields decode both
states directly. Frames must be standard, non-RTR, exactly eight bytes, and
have the expected identifier.

`TURN_SWITCH` continues to normalize the confirmed hazard/right/left switch
bits into `TurnState` and retains the existing 250 ms turn/request freshness
behavior. The supplied DBC has no cycle-time declaration, so the other
confirmed signals expose unconfigured freshness by default; callers can set
per-signal timeouts through `VehicleFreshnessPolicy`. `Signal::refresh()`
still marks an unconfigured value stale when time advances, and snapshots
never mutate the source state. The prior speed candidate and other
out-of-scope definitions remain unchanged.

## Golden vectors and provenance

The following vectors are synthetic, privacy-safe test data. The confirmed
vectors are derived from the reviewed DBC layout and scale; the retained speed
candidate is included only to show that its existing behavior remains intact.
None is a vehicle capture or a claim of Australian-market compatibility.

| `0x228` | `24 81 07 FF 04 F0 00 00` | selector `D`, actual `2nd` | synthetic transmission vector |

The source DBC and raw captures remain outside the repository. Only reviewed
signal definitions and synthetic test vectors are represented here.
